    "In many countries, stocks are cross-listed on multiple exchanges. Depending on your research goals, it may be more useful to work with consolidated historical data (i.e. data representing trades from all exchanges) or historical data from the primary exchange only. [Learn more about primary exchange vs consolidated prices](https://www.quantrocket.com/p/docs/primary-v-consolidated). To maximize research flexibility, collecting the data both waysÂ is a sensible idea. This is demonstrated in the notebooks."
