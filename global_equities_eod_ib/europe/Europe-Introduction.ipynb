    "Subscribing to the relevant IB market data subscriptions can be slightly challenging for European stocks. There is typically a separate subscription for each exchange, but because many stocks are cross-listed on multiple exchanges, collecting consolidated prices often requires permission for numerous exchanges. Review the [market data help guide](https://www.quantrocket.com/h/err/162/md) for tips and techniques for determining which subscriptions are required.\n",
